        <p>
            I went on a solo trip to Japan a few years ago before covid, when I found a cheap ticket to go over there. My first few hours 
            there was nerve racking and honestly terrifying. Before I got off the plane, my phone broke. I couldn't find the wifi device
            that I had delivered to the airport and to make matters worse I couldn't find my airbnb. I had to stay in a hotel nearby the 
            airport for a day to fix my phone and find my package. I was able to do both and in the end was able to enjoy my stay in Japan.
            I went to many different shops and restaurants during my stay and it was honestly the most fun I ever had. The people were very
            nice about the fact I didn't speak japanese at the time. They were very accommodating and honestly some of the nicest people I met.
            I ended up taking Japanese language classes because of this experience and it was the most fun I ever had during my time in college.
