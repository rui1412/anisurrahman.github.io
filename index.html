            <p>
                Hey guys!!! My name is Anisur and I'm currently a senior. I'm currently working on my computer science degree
                and trying to making friends along the way. I love playing video games and watching anime.
                I watch all sorts of animes and I don't have a particular favorite anime series. I love them all.
                I play a wide range of games, including dark souls games such as elden ring, playing/reading visual novels, and playing indie games.
                I mainly play indie games, but my most played game is old school runescape. My favorite game/series is the zero escape series.
                I have finished all the achivements on all three games. The zero escape games/series is a visual novel puzzle game, where you solve
                puzzles in order to escape. I love puzzles and all things that you can build such as gundams and the ROKR puzzles.
                It's always fun and exciting building/solving things, which is why I'm majoring in computer science, since I love
                creating/building things.
