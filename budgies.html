        <p>
            I have four budgies/parakeets. Starting from left to right, its Cookie, Lemon, Melon, and Blue. Our youngest is Cookie
            and she is the feistiest one out of the four. Melon and Blue are the two older brothers that are always fighting/playing with 
            one another. Then we have our sweet boy Lemon, who is the calmest of the four. They all are mischief in their own way, but I still
            love them all. They are hard to take care of, but its very rewarding and fun. Unexpectedly I wouldn't call them beginner pets,
            however if you don't mind the noise and the mess they make, they are very cool pets. When I got my first budgie(Blue), it was
            very spontaneous and I very much don't recommend it, because they require constant attention and make a lot of noise and mess.
            At first I was very annoyed at them, but they soon grew on me and are now a very wonderful part of the family.
